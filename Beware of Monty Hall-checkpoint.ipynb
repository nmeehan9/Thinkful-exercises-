    "You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?\n",

    "\n",
    "I know the answer to this one because I saw the movie 21. Each door has a probability of 33.33% of having the prize behind it. by eliminating one door and NOT switching, you are still sticking with the original 33.33% you had when picking from 3 doors. If you switch however, you get the extra 33.33% from the eliminated door tacked onto the 33.33% of the door you switched to. Giving you a 2/3rds chance of getting the prize instead of only a 1/3rd. "
